# odin-recipes
My first Odin project, Will consist of a main index page and a few links to a few recipes
very rough first html project will have a self reflection at the end


Self Reflection 


Writing this after spending like i think 2+ total hours on this made my first small webstie 
used information from other sites for the recipes and food sources cited within my website 
Learned a bit of Version control and HTMl usage.
